A static page is a page that you want to separate from your normal post content. The most popular examples of a static page are a contact page and an about page. These pages you want to be static so they do not show up in your post feed.

In order to create a static page you create a new post, just like you would any other post. Once you have opened up the new post, there is a cog wheel icon next to where it says `“Save Draft”` or `“Update Post”` depending on if you have published the post or not. Click on that cog, and check the `“Turn this post into a static page”` box. This will convert your post to a static page.
