You can add, edit, delete and reorder menu links on your Ghost blog, directly from the navigation tool within the blog admin area, located at `Design` from the left hand side of your admin area.

![navigation](/assets/images/navigation.png){:class="img"}

To include a static page on your navigation menu, first, type the name of the page as youâ€™d like it to appear on your menu in the label field.

![add-navigation](/assets/images/add-navigation.png){:class="img"}

Next, click inside the URL field of the menu item. The blog URL will auto-populate with `http://yourdomain.com/`. You will need to add in the page slug after the final `/`. Once satisfied with your page link, click the blue Save button to add the page to the navigation menu.
