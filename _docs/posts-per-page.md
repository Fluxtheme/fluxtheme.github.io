With Ghost 1.0, the [“Posts per page”](https://themes.ghost.org/docs/packagejson#section--config-posts_per_page-) setting is now part of the theme. The config purpose is to control how many posts to show per page from the `package.json` file like this:
```json
"config": {
  "posts_per_page": 9
}
```
This theme default value is set to 9 posts per page.
