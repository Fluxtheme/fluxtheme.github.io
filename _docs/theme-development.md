If you are a developer and need to do customization work, the theme is using PostCSS and Gulp, the popular automation tool. This improves the development flow and making it much faster.

This is the step by step to customize the theme

1. Before beginning to customize the theme, you should unzip `theme-name.zip` theme file to `/content/themes/` directory
2. Open a shell and navigate to `/content/themes/theme-name` directory that contains theme's `package.json`.
3. Install a package by running
```bash
npm install
```
